    <h2 class="boxes">What is Money Laundering?</h2>
    <div class = "boxes" id = "div1"><h2>Money laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money obtained from illegal sources such as drug trafficking, corruption, embezzlement, and gambling by saying that it came from a legitimate source.</h2><img src="https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1118800c-2a31-11e3-9705-17b312947581.jpg"></div>

    <div class = "boxes" id = "div2"><h2>Money laundering has many different punishments and penalties based on the amount of money that was laundered.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If $1,500 to $20,000 was laundered, then the penalty is 180 days to 2 years in jail with fines up to $10,000.</li>
        <li>If $20,000 to $100,000 was laundered, then that makes it a third-degree felony resulting in a penalty of 2 to 10 years in jail with a $10,000 fine.</li>
        <li>If $100,000 to $200,000 is laundered, then that makes it a second-degree felony resulting in a penalty of 2 to 20 years in jail with a $10,000 fine.</li>
